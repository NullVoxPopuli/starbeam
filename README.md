Starbeam is a new kind of reactive library. It makes reactive programming simple and fun, and **it works with your existing JavaScript framework.**

It interoperates natively with React state management patterns, Svelte stores,
the Vue composition API, and Ember's auto-tracking system.

## The Big Picture

- **Use normal JavaScript APIs and access patterns.** Build reactive data structures using reactive versions of JavaScript built-ins like objects, arrays, maps, and sets, and update them exactly as you would with normal JavaScript.
- **No delays.** Updates to reactive values take effect immediately. Your reactive data and computations are always coherent, just like normal JavaScript.
- **Works everywhere.** You don't need to learn a new framework to take advantage of Starbeam's cutting edge reactive system. You can render Starbeam data using renderers designed for your framework of choice, or even build your own renderer.
- **TypeScript types are a first-class consideration.** Every part of Starbeam's API was designed from the ground up using TypeScript types with careful attention to the details. And if you're not a TypeScript user, you can still get the benefit in normal JavaScript code through inline suggestions, documentation and tab completion in your editor, no configuration needed.
