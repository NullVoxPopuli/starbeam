# The Vanilla Renderer

The Vanilla Renderer is a minimal, experimental renderer for reactive Starbeam data. It doesn't
depend on any specific framework, and is capable of rendering HTML constructs.

It is intentionally minimal, and in its current form, is not intended to be used as a full-featured
framework.

Rather, it is **a useful demonstration** of how to build a Starbeam renderer, and useful in its own
right for situations where existing frameworks aren't appropriate.

The Vanilla Renderer intentionally does not include any kind of JSX or SFC-like syntax, but instead focuses
on use-cases where a compiler or other framework structure would get in the way.
